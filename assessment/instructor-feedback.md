# Instructor Feedback

## Exceeds Spec

-   **Automate: Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document**
    -   The Quarto document renders a complete document that contains the entire analysis, including an explanation of how `moving_avg()` was constructed using minimization and refactoring. This script allows for locally sourcing a function in another file, clearing space and enabling a cleaner analysis section in `paper.qmd`.
-   **Automate: Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)**
    -   A separate script is stored in the `scratch` folder and contains code and additional comments (documentation) for data cleaning/tidying. This script can be referenced for data cleaning steps.
-   **Document: The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works**
    -   The README is detailed and contains all required sections. The flowchart is included for reference, and the analysis includes insights on data cleaning/functional application to the entire data set utilized in `paper.qmd.`

# Collaboration

Collaborating with a fellow coder was an enriching experience. This experience introduced the opportunity to remotely collaborate via GitHub and practice forking/pulling and creating issues to improve elements of the analysis. For example, I provided feedback on what was missing to meet the requirements of the project, such as creating a data cleaning/tidying script that could be sourced locally for a cleaned dataset to save space.I also received helpful feedback, such as sections that were missing in my README.
