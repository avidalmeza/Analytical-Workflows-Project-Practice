# Analytical-Workflows-Project-Practice
This project serves to replicate a prior figure completed by Schaefer et al. (2000) based on data published by McDowell et al. (2024). Moving nine-week averages were created for each concentration of contaminants at different streams in Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Hugo. The primary objective is to establish a reproducible workflow that is replicable for interested environmental enthusiasts.
