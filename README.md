# Analytical-Workflows-Project-Practice

This project serves to replicate a prior figure completed by [@schaefer2000] based on data published by McDowell et al. (2024). Moving nine-week averages were created for each concentration of contaminants (hereby referred to as "nutrients") at different streams in Puerto Rico before and after Hurricane Hugo. The primary objective is to establish a reproducible workflow that is replicable for interested environmental enthusiasts.

# Background

Hurricane Hugo (1989) greatly affected Puerto Rico's freshwater systems. The extent of the hurricane's impact can be visualized as moving averages (smoothed estimations) of changes in concentrations of contaminants over time at differently sampled streams. This can be replicated from an existing figure created by Schaefer et al.:

## Data
The data is publicly available on the EDI Data Portal and appears as separate files for each sampling site. For this analysis,

-   \scratch: Remote functions used for calculations are stored here. Currently, the primary script "project-practice.R" is stored here.

-   \figs: Contains graphs associated with yearly and nine-week moving averages per contaminant at each site.

-   \data: All raw data is stored here.
